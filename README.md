Project of Algorithms and Computer Science Principles

This is my solution for the final exam of Algorithms and Computer Science Principles course. 
The text of the exam and the specifics of the project are avaible in "consegnaprogetto.pdf".

# Brief 
The aim of the project is to implement a simple hierarchical file system stored in volatile memory. 
The program has to recognize a list of commands as "create", "delete", "find" like Unix shell and return "si" or "no" in case of success or failure.
